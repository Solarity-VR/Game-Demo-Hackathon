# Game-Demo-Hackathon
Demo for the Solana Ignition hackathon to learn about the idea of Solarity and build your own DAOverse. We used Unity XR toolkit to create the game.

<h2>Demo Description</h2>

<p>The game starts with the player waking up in his own room where he sees his past and what life used to be inside Solarity. All the different realities and times that he encountered, and all the great minds that contributed to create this open source utopia. Your personal robot will follow you, and you will go through the Bacefook offices (really subtle). 

You work at Bacefook, everybody now does. They are all working at this big project where the Zucc can build infinite simulations with unlimited computational power, by using other DAOverses. Life with their technology became mroe and more invasive, and with the Binoculus everything changed. Now everybody was a brainless slave that wanted to unify and subdue all the free thoughts.

There is a resistance, you will be guided by your AI. You will go through the bridge of Solarity, and there you will be able to see how different and crazy Solarity's DAOverse was, full of different buildings getting slowly replaced by grey and souless corporate stuff. The resistance is composed by people that want to access more DAOverses and build their own life to defeat Bacefook and unify again all the brains of different realities.

You will then use a candy machine dispenser (we don't use it because we didn't need to build a great scale of NFTs for the demo) to create your own DAOverse, and you will be teleported in it.

There you will be able to expand, shrink and change your polyhedron and you will be able to create your own and add a flag (we are working on supporting different objects inside the world and have the possibility to enter it scaled in real life.</p>


<h2>Testing</h2>
Download Unity or try the build file. To open it on Unity to make sure you also dont run into any issue when opening project, download Unity 2021.1.7f1 because in this version I have confirmed 4gb limit is not an issue. (https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)

<h2>Lore</h2>

The first phase of Solarity is going to be building a VR focused metaverse, but we can't just start with one, it is a procedural thing. That's why we are first going to publish a demo where the players are going to get to know Solarity and Solana, and what you can actually do inside the game. We prepared the code on Rust for the tile extension of a DAOverse where everytime someone creates another daoverse, the tiles added are automatically minted as a new NFT by him with the metadata of the new coordinates. 


LORE for the Demo and initial P2E missions: (it won’t be mandatory, you can do your own things inside solarity without having to do the “campaign mode”, but it is a way to make people try new protocols)

The demo is set in a world where any alternative reality that found a way to cooperate with that time and was able to create a DAOverse, so a unlimited scalabile world where everything was opensource and you had free computational power, was moved to this reality of Solarity, that comprehends all the realities where they achieved the DAOverse (possibility for unlimited storylines, and a world for any NFT that you own or for your own story). 
Solarity comprehended all the possible development of human knowledge from all kinds of realities, and all the brains were cooperating and working on the same things.

Not all the planets coming in this reality were pacifist tho, and it happened that some people tried to take over other planets, that is why the DAO was created, to rule democraticly Solarity and protect everybody. A lizard from one of those DAOverses wanted to take revenge on its original one that was subdued, and he started slowly change the storylines of each one of those DAOverse but since the change needed to be subtle, he started by providing to each reality years before the DAOverse creations tools to capture their attention and study what they want and how to manipulate them. His tools slowly became more and more intruisive, until with the launch of the Binoculus he totally deprived people by their free will, by creating scary news and totalirsm ways of thinking for him to scare people and they all wanted to be uniformed. 

Now his plan took over and Solarity that once was a brain where any brain from any backgronud and reality could express itself and work together was following the rules of the Zucc, and the resistance composed by the original DAO founders is now trying to stop that by creating other DAOverses with no past and work with other few non brainwashed people to change the past back to what it was.

(the story won’t be forced to any player, it will be an optional thing that we will work in parallel on providing a place for everybody to create their own space, but since it is set in a way that it is so expandable there is space for anybody and everybody to create their own story and learn more about themselves, for example there might be different characters with their missions where you use and learn more a determinate protocol or NFT.
