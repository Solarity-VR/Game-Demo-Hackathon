# Game-Demo-Hackathon
This demo will be the introduction to Solarity and will be made as a browser game so that people can access it and receive an NFT when finished it. It was made to let people know 
more about Solarity and what we can do, and to have a storyline so that while other projects and other protocols are joining and building more around the world, there is going to 
be a main P2E story that follows the origin. To keep users updated and always following the project, there are going to be multiplayer competitions inside Solarity from the start.

<h2>Demo description:</h2>

<li>To learn more about the story, read the Lore*

You are an inhabitant of Solarity and here you will be able to explore your apratment with your different NFTs where thanks to them you can access alternative realities and 
different worlds from your watch. You will be helped by your personal robot AI. Every different reality comes from a DAOverse.
After the last update, everybody worked for Bacefook, a corporation led by a li

<h3>What is a DAOverse?</h3>

All the different realities that populated Solarity shared one thing: their civilizations reached a point where an automatically scalable governance layer permited everybody to
decide and have a voice on their development as a species, and they all had something open source that let anybody create and build their own realities, simulations and games. 
So a DAOverse is a tool to create your own simulation based on the work of the best minds of all different realities. 
They all agreed that such technology needed to be open source and accessible to everybody because if privatizated it would mean too much power, until...

<h3>What is BaceFook?</h3>

Bacefook is a corporation led by a multiformed being with the goal of privatizing all the knowledge ever known by stealing data and thoughts and researching everything that was happening
inside the universe. To do so and to break a place that otherwise would have been peaceful and the maximum expression of human brains, he started by creating tools to steal people attention
and not letting them get information on their own, because he noticed that the first sign of evolution was people actually getting informed with good resources and people had critical thinking.
So he started with that, and started to spread fake news and alarmism so that the inhabitants of the different DAOverses would start hating eachother and they gradually stopped liking the diverse,
and by providing everybody a tool where they can constantly mesure themselves with unrealistic standards, they start to be fooled in thinking that they are leaving, ironically enough in a
reality actually impossible to reach. He made people scared of exploring their own mind, so a lot of people were against free DAOverses. 
So they all started to conform more and search for refuge on a screen until the Bacefook were more and more invasive and when the Binoculus launched,  
The Z.U.C.C. actually got access to every single different brain ever existed and reprogrammed them. Now all of Solarity is brainwashed by Bacefook and their hippocamus is used as storage for 
offline ads.

<h3>Who are the Resistance?</h3>

<h2>Testing</h2>
Download Unity or try the build file. To open it on Unity to make sure you also dont run into any issue when opening project, download Unity 2021.1.7f1 because in this version I have confirmed 4gb limit is not an issue. (https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)

<h2>Lore</h2>

The first phase of Solarity is going to be building a VR focused metaverse, but we can't just start with one, it is a procedural thing. That's why we are first going to publish a demo where the players are going to get to know Solarity and Solana, and what you can actually do inside the game. We prepared the code on Rust for the tile extension of a DAOverse where everytime someone creates another daoverse, the tiles added are automatically minted as a new NFT by him with the metadata of the new coordinates. 


LORE for the Demo and initial P2E missions: (it won’t be mandatory, you can do your own things inside solarity without having to do the “campaign mode”, but it is a way to make people try new protocols)

The demo is set in a world where any alternative reality that found a way to cooperate with that time and was able to create a DAOverse, so a unlimited scalabile world where everything was opensource and you had free computational power, was moved to this reality of Solarity, that comprehends all the realities where they achieved the DAOverse (possibility for unlimited storylines, and a world for any NFT that you own or for your own story). 
Solarity comprehended all the possible development of human knowledge from all kinds of realities, and all the brains were cooperating and working on the same things.

Not all the planets coming in this reality were pacifist tho, and it happened that some people tried to take over other planets, that is why the DAO was created, to rule democraticly Solarity and protect everybody. A lizard from one of those DAOverses wanted to take revenge on its original one that was subdued, and he started slowly change the storylines of each one of those DAOverse but since the change needed to be subtle, he started by providing to each reality years before the DAOverse creations tools to capture their attention and study what they want and how to manipulate them. His tools slowly became more and more intruisive, until with the launch of the Binoculus he totally deprived people by their free will, by creating scary news and totalirsm ways of thinking for him to scare people and they all wanted to be uniformed. 

Now his plan took over and Solarity that once was a brain where any brain from any backgronud and reality could express itself and work together was following the rules of the Zucc, and the resistance composed by the original DAO founders is now trying to stop that by creating other DAOverses with no past and work with other few non brainwashed people to change the past back to what it was.

(the story won’t be forced to any player, it will be an optional thing that we will work in parallel on providing a place for everybody to create their own space, but since it is set in a way that it is so expandable there is space for anybody and everybody to create their own story and learn more about themselves, for example there might be different characters with their missions where you use and learn more a determinate protocol or NFT.
